   ### [ESP-Drone Overview](https://github.com/delterio/esp-drone/tree/master)

   ESP-Drone is an ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 based flying development board provided by ![Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en). ESP-Drone is equipped with Wi-Fi key features, which allows this drone to be connected to and controlled by an APP or a gamepad over a Wi-Fi     network. This  drone comes with simple-structured hardware, clear codes, and supports functional extension. Therefore, ESP-Drone can be used in STEAM education. Part of the codes is from Crazyflie open source project under  GPL3.0 license.

   ### [How to Make An Arduino Quadcopter Drone: Step-by-Step DIY Project](http://www.brokking.net/)

   ![Arduino Quadcopter Drone](https://www.mydronelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arduino-Quadcopter-DIY-810x608.jpg)

   If you love the idea of building your own quadcopter but haven’t got a clue how and where to start, you are definitely on the right page. We know how difficult and frustrating the research can be, so we decided to make a tutorial for      building your      own quadcopter using an Arduino board. We hope that you will find it useful.

   And, to get you even more excited about your upcoming project, here is an Arduino quadcopter in action:

   ##  [The STM32 Quadcopter](http://www.brokking.net/ymfc-32_main.html)

   The YMFC-32 is a STM32 based quadcopter that is easy to build and fun to fly. The auto level functionality makes it also a very capable starting quadcopter. Auto leveling means that, when you release the sticks the quadcopter levelsit self.

   The total cost to build the YMFC-32 is approximately $135.

   Check step 2 below for a complete hardware list for all the individual parts. This includes a battery, transmitter, charger, resistors, etc. 

   ![O quadcopter STM32](http://www.brokking.net/YMFC-32/YMFC-32_01.jpg)

   The YMFC-32 is not a high level flight controller. The purpose of the YMFC-32 is to provide a simple and understandable code that is needed to build a DIY quadcopter flight controller.

   The code is well commented and clearly explained in the YMFC-32 video tutorials. This makes it possible to further develop the YMFC-32 flight controller code for your own purpose.

   If you encounter any problems during the build or setup please check the Q&A page first. Most questions are already answered in detail.

  ArduPilot is the most advanced, full-featured, and reliable open source autopilot software available. It has been under development since 2010 by a diverse team of professional engineers, computer scientists, and community contributors. Our            autopilot software is capable of controlling almost any vehicle system imaginable, from conventional airplanes, quad planes, multi-rotors, and helicopters to rovers, boats, balance bots, and even submarines. It is continually being expanded to         provide support for new emerging vehicle types.

   ### ![Open Source Drones:](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/drone-projects)

   This page is a resource for the drone community supporting multi-rotor Drones based on ![Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). 

   ![Octacopter](https://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/images/Drones/Drone-20161209_143012-1400x888.jpg)

   The ubiquity of the electric multi-rotor drone was made possible by Arduino based flight software and Linux based ground station planning software. Some drone manufacturers like 3D Robotics and Yuneec have stayed true to the ![Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) roots while the industry leader DJI is predominantly closed source and proprietary.

  Multi-rotor Configurations:

   - Tricopter: three motors/three arms
   - Quadcopter: four motors/four arms
   - Hexacopter: six motors/six arms
   - Octacopter: eight motors/eight arms
   - Y6: two motors on each of three arms
   - X8: two motors on each of four arms

   ### ![OpenDroneMap](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap)

So you've used a drone to capture a bunch of overhead imagery of an area of interest. Now what? OpenDroneMap may be able to help. This software takes this aerial imagery and helps you process it into point clouds, digital surface and elevation models, or just orthorectify the imagery (in essence, line up the imagery to a known coordinate system for further analysis).

Grab the source or a beta release on ![GitHub](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM) under a GPLv3 license, as well as a sample data set, and see whether it's a good fit for you; the project's wiki has more information. OpenDroneMap is designed to be run in Linux and can be run with Docker to avoid needing the exact configuration environment the project was built for.

   ###  Dronecode

The Dronecode project is a Linux Foundation-sponsored project working to build a common open source platform for UAV development. It's been through a lot of changes in the last few years, but today it serves as the governance structure for the components of the overall platform, where the project's actual development occurs. Those components include the ![PX4](https://px4.io/) autopilot flight control system, the ![MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) robotics communication toolkit, and the ![QGroundControl](https://qgroundcontrol.com/) user interface for flight control, mission planning, and configuration, all of which have individual GitHub repositories.
