   ### [ESP-Drone Overview](https://github.com/delterio/esp-drone/tree/master)

   ESP-Drone is an ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 based flying development board provided by Espressif. ESP-Drone is equipped with Wi-Fi key features, which allows this drone to be connected to and controlled by an APP or a gamepad over a Wi-Fi     network. This  drone comes with simple-structured hardware, clear codes, and supports functional extension. Therefore, ESP-Drone can be used in STEAM education. Part of the codes is from Crazyflie open source project under  GPL3.0 license.

   If you love the idea of building your own quadcopter but havenâ€™t got a clue how and where to start, you are definitely on the right page. We know how difficult and frustrating the research can be, so we decided to make a tutorial for      building your      own quadcopter using an Arduino board. We hope that you will find it useful.

   And, to get you even more excited about your upcoming project, here is an Arduino quadcopter in action:

   ##  [The STM32 quadcopter](http://www.brokking.net/ymfc-32_main.html)

   The YMFC-32 is a STM32 based quadcopter that is easy to build and fun to fly. The auto level functionality makes it also a very capable starting quadcopter. Auto leveling means that, when you release the sticks the quadcopter levelsit self.

   The total cost to build the YMFC-32 is approximately $135.

   Check step 2 below for a complete hardware list for all the individual parts. This includes a battery, transmitter, charger, resistors, etc.

   The YMFC-32 is not a high level flight controller. The purpose of the YMFC-32 is to provide a simple and understandable code that is needed to build a DIY quadcopter flight controller.

   The code is well commented and clearly explained in the YMFC-32 video tutorials. This makes it possible to further develop the YMFC-32 flight controller code for your own purpose.

   If you encounter any problems during the build or setup please check the Q&A page first. Most questions are already answered in detail.
